* A study was performed to determine the efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in treating the therapeutically refractory F98 glioma, using boronophenylalanine (BPA) as the capture agent. F98 glioma cells were implanted into the brains of rats. Three groups of rats were studied. One group went untreated, another was treated only with radiation, and the third group received radiation plus an appropriate concentration of BPA. The data for the three groups lists the death times ( in days) and is given below:

|Untreated| Radiated |Radiated + BPA|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|20| 26| 31|
|21|28 |32|
 |23| 29| 34|
 |24| 29 |35|
 |24 |30 |36|
 |26 |30 |38|
 |26|31|38|
 |27 |31 |39|
 |28 |32 |42(Censored obs)|
 |30 |35(Censored obs) |42(Censored obs)|d
 
    * a) Compare the survival curves for the three groups.
    * b) Perform pairwise tests to determine if ther is any difference in survial between pairs of groups.
    * c) There is priori evidence that, if there is a difference in survival, there should be a natural ordering, namely, untreated animals will have the worst survial, radiated ratss will have slightly improved survival, and the radiated ratss + BPA should have the test survival. Perform the test for trend which would test this ordered hypothesis.
