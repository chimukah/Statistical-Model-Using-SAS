# Problem 7.6 in Textbook
* One of the goals of recent research is to explore the efficacy of triple-drug combinations of antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV- infected patients. Because of limitations on potency and the continuing emergence of drug resistance seen with the use of currently available antiretroviral agents in monotherapy and two-drug regimens, triple- combination regimens should represent a more promising approach to maximize antiviral activity, maintain long-term efficacy, and reduce the incidence of drug resistance. Towards this end, investigators per- formed a randomized study comparing AZT 􏰀 zalcitabine (ddC) versus AZT 􏰀 zalcitabine (ddC) 􏰀 saquinavir. The data, time from administra- tion of treatment (in days) until the CD4 count reached a prespecified level, is given below for the two groups.
   * AZT+ zalcitabine (ddC): 85, 32, 38+, 45, 4+, 84, 49, 180+, 87, 75, 102, 39, 12, 11, 80, 35, 6
   * AZT+  zalcitabine (ddC) + saquinavir: 22, 2, 48, 85, 160, 238, 56+, 94+, 51+, 12, 171, 80, 180, 4, 90, 180+, 3
* Use the log rank statistic to test if there is a difference in the distribution of the times at which patient’s CD4 reaches the prespecified level for the two treatments.
