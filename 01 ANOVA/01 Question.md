* Three brands of batteries are under study. It is suspect- ed that the lives (in weeks) of the three brands are different. Five randomly selected batteries of each brand are tested with the following results:

|Brand1 |Brand2 |Brand3|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|100|  76 | 108|
|96 |80 |100|
|92 |75 |96|
|96 |84 |98|
|92 |82| 100|

   * (a) Are the lives of these brands of batteries different?
   * (b) Analyze the residuals from this experiment.
   * (c) Construct a 95 percent confidence interval estimate on the mean life of battery brand 2. Construct a 99 per- cent confidence interval estimate on the mean differ- ence between the lives of battery brands 2 and 3.
   * (d) Which brand would you select for use? If the manu- facturer will replace without charge any battery that fails in less than 85 weeks, what percentage would the company expect to replace?
